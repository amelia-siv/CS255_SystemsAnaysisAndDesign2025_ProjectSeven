# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design? 
The DriverPass project was based on creating a web-based system for a client named Liam. He wanted a single platform where students could prepare for their driver’s tests through online practice exams and also schedule in-person driving lessons. The system needed to support multiple roles such as administrators, IT officers, secretaries, students, and instructors, and allow for secure tracking, scheduling, and communication. The main goal was to make the learning and scheduling process simple, organized, and easily accessible for all users.

# What did you do particularly well?
I think I did well in utilizting tools when developing the UML diagrams. They showed how each part of the system connects and communicates. These visuals helped bring the system to life and made it easier to understand how users, data, and system components interacted. I also made sure my documentation was consistent and directly tied back to the client’s requirements.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I were to revise one part, it would be the section about system maintenance and issue tracking. I’d include more detail about how the system handles user-reported problems and updates by outlining a built-in ticketing system for technical support. This would make the design more realistic and show how the system could stay reliable after launch.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user’s needs by analyzing the client interview transcript and focusing on the main pain points mentioned such as scheduling difficulties and the need for accessible practice materials. I made sure my design directly addressed those areas, emphasizing a user-friendly interface and efficient communication between students, instructors, and admins. It’s important to consider the user’s needs because even the most advanced system won’t succeed if it’s not intuitive or doesn’t solve the problems users actually face.

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
When designing software, I like to start by breaking the project into smaller, manageable pieces. I use techniques like use case diagrams, sequence diagrams, and data flow modeling to understand how users and systems will interact. Taking notes from the interview transcript, highlighting key needs, and looking at my work with a fresh set of eyes helped me keep the requirements clear. I also try to think from the user’s perspective, making sure each step in the process feels natural. In the future, I plan to rely even more on user feedback early in the design phase and continue using structured documentation to keep the system organized and clear for everyone involved.
